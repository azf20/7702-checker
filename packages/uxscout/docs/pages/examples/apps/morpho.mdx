- Bundling multiple deposits reduces the number of transactions a user has to make
- Pending deposits (in a yet to be submitted bundle) are indicated in the UI
- Approvals for the same token are also aggregated (for USDC in this case)
- Exact amounts are used for approval
- Morpho does not currently support EIP-5792, so approval and deposit requires two separate transactions even for smart accounts
- Closing the slideout is a bit unintuitive, I found myself inadvertantly removing an item from the bundle
- "Finalise bundle" on the second deposit only showed the second deposit, rather than the whole bundle as I expected
- My first deposit transaction failed with an "out of gas" error.
