- Signed up with email & a passkey signer
- Created a custom action to transfer 0.001 ETH every minute a maximum of two times, which was successfully triggered twice
- Paid for transaction with ETH, though paid 0.000235 ETH to the sponsor when the [transaction fee was 0.000176 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd9f69b1ecd50df69baeceb6ebbf9cd37e4c5747e302939195b25551a987c3011)
- Default gas settings were previously too low for mainnet, increased to 0.5 max priority
- Second execution didn't show up in the UI, though it was visible on Etherscan
- It isn't that clear that only mainnet is supported on the "Receive" screen
