## Approve swap" in one transaction

Uniswap has integrated EIP-5792 to batch approval and swap in a single transaction if supported by the connected wallet via `sendCalls`. If explicitly not supported by the wallet, the prior two step flow is surfaced, and if `sendCalls` fails, a fallback option is offered.
