## Overview

YO (Yield Optimizer) is a DeFi protocol that automatically moves funds across the best-performing pools across different blockchains to maximize risk-adjusted yield. It leverages Exponential.fi's Risk Ratings to balance risks and rewards, providing users with a simple and secure way to earn more from their crypto assets.

- Leverages [enso.build](https://www.enso.build/) for simple crosschain deposits
- No EIP-5792 support, so depositing USDC requires a separate approval transaction
- No deposit progress tracking in-app (just wait for balance to increment)
- Reasoning for 24-hour withdrawal time is unclear (from the [documentation](https://docs.yo.xyz/how-to-withdraw-from-yo) this only applies to large withdrawals, which could be made clearer in-app)
- Mislabelling the withdrawal toast ("Request WETH for redemption")
