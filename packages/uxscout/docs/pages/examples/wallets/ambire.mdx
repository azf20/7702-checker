Ambire's account settings provide a clear overview of your account's smart status across chains, including whether you are using a different wallet's smart account (for example Metamask).

There is a clear action to Enable or Revoke, but this is a bit inefficient in the case where a different wallet's implementation is used (you need to make two transactions, once to revoke and then to enable, when you could simply make a single type 4 transaction to override with the Ambire wallet).

Switching transactions are paid for by the user. Further testing identified some issues with Gnosis chain revocation, potentially related to an issue with RPC reliability.
