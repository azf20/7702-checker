Metamask now shows smart account status by chain in the Account Details view, and lets you switch between smart and standard accounts.

Current status and action could be visibly more obvious, and chains using delegations from other wallets are identified as "Standard".

Switch transactions are paid for by the user, and display the nonce for Metamask's currently connected chain in the confirmation modal, rather than the switching chain, but further testing indicates that the correct nonce is submitted.
